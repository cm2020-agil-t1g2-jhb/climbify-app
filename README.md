# Climbify App

This is the repository for public hosting of the progressive web app. 

It does not contain the source code, which can be found in the `climbify-source` repository instead. 

To update, run `npm run build` in the `climbify-source` repo and commit the _contents_ of the resulting `build` folder into this project (replacing everything, except this README.md). 

The link to productive hosted web app is: https://cm2020-agil-t1g2-jhb.github.io/climbify-app/index.html
